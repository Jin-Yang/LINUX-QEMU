This is a suit for test a basci PCI-CAN device in QEMU, including a PCI-CAN device and a Linux driver for it. 
Note: the IRQ problem has not been solved.


pci_can.c
   QEMU PCI-CAN device simulation code.
qemu_char.c
	CAN backend.
linux_driver
   a linux driver to test the device.



== PREPARE ==
This is base on the QEMU-Linux environment, and we boot linux through NFS. Before test it, we should change some environment variabes.

   linux_driver/Makefile: KERNEL_PATH, change it to your dir of linux source.
   linux_driver/copy.sh: NFS_PATH, change it to the root of NFS filesystem.



== TEST ==
Then we can test it through the following steps.

Step 0:
	$ sudo insmod /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/can/vcan.ko
	$ sudo ip link add type vcan
	$ ip link set vcan0 up

	Insert the vcan modules, as we mentioned above. Run **./candump vcan0** under can-utils directory.

Step 1:
	Start qemu with **"-chardev can,id=sja1000,port=vcan0 -device pci-can,chardev=sja1000"**.

Step 2:
	Change your dir to /home/qemu_test_pci and **./load** .

Step 3:
	Run a simple application, **./a.out** , you will get the message in host linux.
