This is a suit for serial. We just copy the source code from Linux-kernel and QEMU.

8250
    a linux driver to test serial.
QEMU
    QEMU serial device simulation code.
   

== PREPARE ==
This is base on the QEMU-Linux environment, and we boot linux through NFS. Before test it, we should change some environment variabes.

   8250/Makefile: KERNEL_PATH, change it to your dir of linux source.
   8250/copy.sh: NFS_PATH, change it to the root of NFS filesystem.



== TEST ==
Then we can test it through the following steps.

	1). start QEMU using the following arguments.
	 -serial none -chardev vc,id=PCIserial -device pci-serial,chardev=PCIserial

	2). type "info pci" in QEMU monitor, and you will find message like this,
		Serial port: PCI device 1b36:002
			IRQ 11
			BAR0: I/O at 0xc050 [0xc057]
			id ""
		also, you can type "lspci" in QEMU, and get msessage like
        00:03:0 Class 0700: 1b36:0002

	3). compile the serial driver.
		make && sudo ./copy

	4). insert the serial driver in QEUM.
		cd /home/serial; ./load

	5). test
		# echo test>/dev/ttyS0
		you will get test in PCIserial console.
		# cat /dev/ttyS0
		if input some message to PCIserial console, then you will get it in QEMU-Linux.
